# Ryanair_Flight_Prediction
A model built during the interview process with Ryanair (Europe's Largest Carrier) that predicted the ancillary revenue for a sample of flights in 2023. The work resulted in an offer from the company.

I was prompted with the following instructions: 

Build a model to predict the Ancillary Revenue for a sample of flights departing this summer (2023).

In order to complete this task you have been provided with three datasets:

data_flight_20k - Contains the flight details for a sample of 20K flights due to depart between April 1st 2022 and September 30th 2022.
data_sales_20k - Contains the ancillary sales data for the 20K sampled flights.
validation_set - A set of flights departing between April 1st 2023 and September 30th 2023. The goal is to predict the total ancillary revenue for these flights.

For the analysis you can use any software or programming language of your choosing. Once completed please submit the following items:
  1) A document in which the candidate should demonstrate their ability to:
    1a) Perform data exploration and cleaning.
    1b) Choose appropriate features for the model
    1c) Select and justify the choice of a predictive model.
    1d) Train and validate the model.
    1e) Evaluate the performance of the model and explain any metrics used for evaluation.
    1f) Discuss the limitations of the model and any potential future improvements.
2) The validation set containing your predicted ancillary revenues.
3) Your code/notebook containing comments/markdown explaining the process.
